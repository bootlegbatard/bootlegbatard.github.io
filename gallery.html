<p>We have a rotating menu that changes with the seasons. Here is a sampling of a few of our favorite things.</p>

<!-- <ul class="photo-gallery">
    {% for image in page.images %}
      <li><img src="{{ image.image_path }}" alt="{{ image.title}}" width="300px" height="300px"/></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul> -->

  {% include image-gallery.html folder="/img/Gallery" %}
