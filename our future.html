<p>Bootleg Bâtard Bakery is the answer to the near north’s demand for authentic, delicious, artisan breads and pastries. Beginning as a micro bakery, Bootleg Bâtard uses a wood-fired oven and sells their hand-crafted wares at local farmers markets.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a brick and mortar location.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping Bootleg Bâtard become a year round brick-and-mortar location, please contact Melina at melina@bootlegbatard.com.</p>
