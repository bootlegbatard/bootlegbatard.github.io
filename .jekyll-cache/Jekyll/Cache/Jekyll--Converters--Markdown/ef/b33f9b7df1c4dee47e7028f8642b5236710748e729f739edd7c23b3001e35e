I"$<p>How can I tell if it’s ripe? See the fine bubbles on the surface and the gentle creasing? Those are good indications. I use these visuals, volume (notice it is something where I can measure the volume easily), and time to determine sourdough maturity. Some people say to see if the starter floats in cool water. I think this is a really bad way to assess ripeness— once you have significant carbon dioxide production from the yeast, it will float for some time on either side of that perfect fermentation window ledge. Don’t fall out!</p>
