I"ù<p>I thought you could use some positive news in these uncertain days. Iâ€™ve been busy since the last update. Iâ€™ve zigzagged the country teaching professional classes, met with the rest of the board to plan for the Bread Bakers Guild for the year, and toured a zillion bakeries to get inspiration and better solidify my own plans. The generosity of the baking community continues to take my breath away.</p>

<p style="font-size:5">The incredible team at Sun Street Breads in Minneapolis. Solveig Tofte, owner of Sun Street, Chair of the Bread Bakers Guild of Americaâ€™s Board, and all around badass insistent I come study her bakery and others. Thank goodness she did!</p>

<p>I like to think of yeast on one side of the seesaw, and lactobacillus on the other side. Too much yeast and you won't have as much acidity. Too much acid and the yeast becomes sluggish, producing too little carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Control the yeast to lactobacillus ratio with proportion of "seed" starter that you dose your starter with in regular feedings, and by controlling temperature and frequency of feeding. Most important, taste and observe your starter fine tuning for the flavor you like. I prefer a mild-lactic quality to my starter. For me, I want it to taste like yogurt, rather than have a sharp acidity.</p>

<p>Next post will be on temperature and consistency of starter. And what happens when you use whole wheat or rye flour. Kay?</p>
