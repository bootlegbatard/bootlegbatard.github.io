I"¾<p>I thought you could use some positive news in these uncertain days. Iâ€™ve been busy since the last update. Iâ€™ve zigzagged the country teaching professional classes, met with the rest of the board to plan for the Bread Bakers Guild for the year, and toured a zillion bakeries to get inspiration and better solidify my own plans. The generosity of the baking community continues to take my breath away.</p>

<p style="font-size:60%">The incredible team at Sun Street Breads in Minneapolis. Solveig Tofte, owner of Sun Street, Chair of the Bread Bakers Guild of Americaâ€™s Board, and all around badass insistent I come study her bakery and others. Thank goodness she did!</p>

<p>While visiting Moxie Baking Co in Louisville, CO, my friend and hero Andy Clark told me that a million miracles are coming my way. And donâ€™t you know, heâ€™s exactly right? From the farmer and miller who have been delivering local flour to me to the baker that volunteered to reconfigure my pro forma-- I feel so incredibly fortunate for the new and old friends who have reached out to provide guidance as I learn all of the things I didnâ€™t know that I donâ€™t know.</p>
