I"›<p>I thought you could use some positive news in these uncertain days. Iâ€™ve been busy since the last update. Iâ€™ve zigzagged the country teaching professional classes, met with the rest of the board to plan for the Bread Bakers Guild for the year, and toured a zillion bakeries to get inspiration and better solidify my own plans. The generosity of the baking community continues to take my breath away.</p>
