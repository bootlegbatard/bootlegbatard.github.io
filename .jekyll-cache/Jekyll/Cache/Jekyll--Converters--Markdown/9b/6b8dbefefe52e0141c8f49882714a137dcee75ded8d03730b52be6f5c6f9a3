I"<p>It isn't just flour, water and yeast. In fact, one of the most important components growing in that gruel is the microflora-- a spectrum of lactobacillus bacterium, that gives unique flavor, acidity, increased shelf life, and greater digestibility to your bread. But is there too much of a good thing?</p>

<p>I like to think of yeast on one side of the seesaw, and lactobacillus on the other side. Too much yeast and you won't have as much acidity. Too much acid and the yeast becomes sluggish, producing too little carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>I maintain a few different cultures: liquid white, rye, and sometimes stiff white. But I set whole grain starters up for specific use. They’re just too needy (as in: need to be fed more often). The magic is in the fermentation. Bran is inherently bitter— like me. When you ferment it, it becomes sweet— like me. Whole grain flours also have less capacity to trap gas, creating interesting bubbles (alveoles) and lightness in a final loaf.</p>
