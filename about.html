<p>Bootleg BÃ¢tard began as a wood-fired micro-bakery in our permaculture landscape in Skokie. Thanks to our community and their desire to learn about sustainability, eating well, and meeting people in their neighborhood, one of our dreams became reality when we held a successful Kickstarter in 2012. We have loved popping-up and serving the farmers markets, but demand has outgrown our capacity. We had a successful Kickstarter in 2020 to fundraise toward a new, larger oven in a brick-and-mortar location. We are eternally grateful for the support of Niyama Yoga for providing us an original location.</p>


<p class="mb-5">Our wood-fired oven will continue to be used for fundraising events.</p>
